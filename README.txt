Hello, this is my tanks game I created to closely match the classic Wii Play Tanks game. There are 9 total levels where you
will come incontact with 5 different types of tanks, each of which are listed below. You can control your tank (blue tank)
using the W, S, D, and A keys to move, left mouse click to shoot, and spacebar to plant bombs. Enjoy!
